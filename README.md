## Data Science and Time Series Forecasting <a name="TS"></a>

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mewbius/ecommerce-products
Description: the dataset contains a small sample of labeled examples and a lot of unlabeled product information. You will have several tasks on this dataset with classification of product category based on description being the main task.

Tasks:
1. Cite 3 scientific papers that suggest approaches that can be used for the main task (aka classification of product categories using descriptions) of this problem. Present a very short summary of the key aspects of the papers (may be in bullet points).
2. Select productsfull.csv dataset. Use only description column to extract the color of the product whenever applicable. Compare your results with the colorname columns
3. Using the same dataset, extract a set of keywords describing each category. What methods did you use for keywords extraction? Explain.
4. Separate part of the productsclassified.csv dataset and keep it for evaluation purposes (letâ€™s call the rest training data). Now, first, take again productsfull.csv that has no Classification column (aka no label). Use description column to pretrain a language model and then using training data build a product classification pipeline with zero-shot and few-shot approaches separately. Provide your model performance evaluation on the separated evaluation set.
5. Which approach provided better results? Zero-shot learning or few-shot learning? Why?
6. You have successfully created an ML model that has a great performance. They have been using the model for 2 years. Then suddenly the model performance drops. What could have possibly resulted in this outcome. Could you have prevented it? If yes how. If not, what can you do now?

Submission: Please use Python for the project. Please create a jupyter notebook with your solutions. Use markdown to answer the questions and describe your code. Push your work to github. Make sure you have all the info for creating your working environment. Use this form to submit your work: https://forms.gle/wVAcjBgSWwcp7HyH9
